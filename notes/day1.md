# Day 1 Notes — Python Foundations & Setup

## What I Worked On
- Set up development environment (Python, Git, VS Code)
- Created first GitHub repository: `python-security-utils`
- Wrote basic Python utility scripts

## Concepts Learned
### Python Basics
- Variables and data types
- Lists and dictionaries
- Conditional statements and loops
- Writing reusable functions
- Using the `main()` pattern in Python

### Clean Code Practices
- Meaningful variable names
- Breaking logic into functions
- Writing docstrings for clarity

### Git & GitHub
- Initializing a Git repository
- Making small, meaningful commits
- Pushing code to GitHub

## Scripts Built
- `number_analyzer.py`: computes min, max, and average from user input
- `string_cleaner.py`: cleans and normalizes input strings
- `file_reader.py`: reads a text file and counts lines and words

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding how to structure code using functions
- Remembering Git commands during the first push

## Key Takeaways
- Writing clean, readable code is more important than writing complex code
- Pushing code daily builds discipline and public consistency

## Next Steps
- Learn Python error handling
- Build scripts that handle real-world failures
- Improve robustness of Day 1 code
