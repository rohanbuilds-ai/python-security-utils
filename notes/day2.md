# Day 2 Notes — Error Handling & Practical Utilities

## What I Worked On
- Learned Python error handling
- Built a real-world log file analyzer
- Improved robustness of Day 1 scripts
- Made my first open-source issue interaction

## Concepts Learned
### Error Handling
- Using `try` and `except`
- Handling `FileNotFoundError` and invalid input
- Writing defensive code that fails gracefully

### File Parsing
- Reading files line by line
- Searching for patterns in text
- Counting occurrences of specific keywords

### Iterative Improvement
- Revisiting previous code to improve quality
- Refactoring for clarity and maintainability

## Script Built
- `log_parser.py`: analyzes log files and reports total lines, error counts, and warnings

## Open-Source Interaction
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` of a target repository
- Commented on an open issue to signal intent and understanding

## Challenges Faced
- Handling unexpected file input errors
- Deciding how much logic to place inside functions

## Key Takeaways
- Real-world code must handle failure cases
- Improving old code is as important as writing new code
- Small public interactions build mentor visibility early

## Next Steps
- Learn Git branching and deeper Git workflows
- Write Bash scripts for automation
- Start reading larger open-source codebases
