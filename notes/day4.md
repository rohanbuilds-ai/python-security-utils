# Day 4 Notes — Reading a Real Open-Source Codebase

## Repository Explored
- **Project:** OWASP ZAP
- **Repository:** zaproxy/zaproxy
- **Domain:** Web security / vulnerability scanning

## What the Project Does
OWASP ZAP is a web application security scanner used to find vulnerabilities
such as SQL injection, XSS, and misconfigurations. It is commonly used by
security professionals and developers during testing.

## High-Level Folder Structure
(Only key folders observed)

- `src/`  
  Contains the main application source code.

- `test/`  
  Contains automated tests.

- `docs/`  
  Documentation related to usage and development.

This structure indicates a large, mature project with clear separation
between core logic, testing, and documentation.

## One File I Studied in Detail
**File name:** `<put file name here>`

### Purpose of the File
(In simple words)
This file is responsible for:
- What problem it solves
- Why it exists in the project

### Key Functions / Classes
- `<function_or_class_1>` — what it does
- `<function_or_class_2>` — what it does

### Inputs
- What kind of data this file receives
- From where (user input, network, other modules)

### Outputs
- What this file produces or modifies
- How other parts of the system use it

### My Understanding (Plain English)
Explain the file as if you are teaching a beginner.
Avoid technical jargon where possible.

## Issues I Looked At

### Issue 1
- **Type:** Bug / Enhancement / Good first issue
- **Problem summary:** What is broken or missing?
- **Possible area in code:** Which folder or file might be involved?
- **My current understanding:** (No solution yet, just reasoning)

### Issue 2 (Optional)
- Same structure as above

## What I Found Challenging
- Parts of the codebase that were hard to understand
- Concepts or terminology I need to learn more about

## Key Takeaways
- Reading a large codebase requires patience and focus
- Understanding the problem is more important than rushing to code
- Good projects have clear structure but still take time to understand

## Next Steps
- Learn how to reproduce a bug locally
- Practice reading stack traces
- Prepare for making a small, meaningful contribution
