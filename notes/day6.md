# Day 6 Notes — Preparing for a UI Fix

## Issue
- Link: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/9114
- Summary: Text hidden when switching Look & Feel in Site Details

## Current Skill Gap
I am not yet familiar with Java Swing UI and layout handling.

## What I Understand So Far
- The issue is related to UI layout not refreshing after Look & Feel change
- The problem likely exists in a JPanel-based UI class
- Layout managers control how text is displayed
- UI updates often require revalidation and repainting

## Next Learning Step
Learn basic Swing layout handling and understand how UI refresh is triggered
after Look & Feel changes.

## Current Status
Investigation complete. Fix postponed until UI fundamentals are understood.
