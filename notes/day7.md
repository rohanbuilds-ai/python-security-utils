# Day 7 Notes — Week 1 Consolidation & Strategy

## What I Achieved This Week
- Built a clean Python package
- Learned Git workflows and branching
- Understood how to read a large OSS codebase
- Reproduced and analyzed a real issue

## Challenges Faced
- UI/Swing knowledge gap
- Understanding complex UI layout logic

## Strategic Decision
I decided to postpone UI-related fixes and focus on non-UI contributions
for my first PR to build confidence and mentor trust.

## Next Focus Area
- Logic / tests / documentation based issues
- Gradual learning of UI concepts in parallel

## Confidence Level
Higher than Day 1. Comfortable with OSS workflows and investigation.
