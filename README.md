# Python Security Utils

A collection of **practical Python utility scripts** focused on  
**security, robustness, and real-world engineering practices**.

This repository is part of my **GSoC 2026 preparation** (AI/ML + Cybersecurity track)  
and is intended to grow into a reusable toolkit for security analysis,
log processing, and ML pipeline support.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build **clean, defensive Python utilities**
- Practice **real-world error handling**
- Develop habits aligned with **open-source standards**
- Gradually extend toward **AI + Security use cases**
